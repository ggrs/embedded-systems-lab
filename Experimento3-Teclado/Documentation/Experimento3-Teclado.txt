Module "PC"        (component AsynchroSerial)
   - PC_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the preferred 
                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read.
   - PC_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar method 
                only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be stored. 
                Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is available 
                only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - PC_RecvBlock -If any data is received, this method returns the block of the data and its length (and incidental error), 
                otherwise it returns an error code (it does not wait for data).  This method is available only if non-zero 
                length of the input buffer is defined and the receiver property is enabled.  If less than requested number of 
                characters is received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user specified 
                destination. The value ERR_EXEMPTY is returned and the value of variable pointed by the Rcv parameter is set to 
                the number of received characters.

                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read.
   - Wifi_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar

                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.

                battery backed up.     (SoftInit = TRUE). Only registers that are not backed up are initialized (Interrupt 
                priority …). RTC device is running, time and date a preserved, RTC interrupts (events) are preserved too.   
                Allocates memory for the device data structure.   This method can be called only once. Before the second call

                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in

                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.

                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - L2_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or a 
                register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - L2_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - L2_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "L3"        (component BitIO)
   - L3_SetDir -Sets a pin direction (available only if the direction = _[input/output]_).
   - L3_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "L4"        (component BitIO)
   - L4_SetDir -Sets a pin direction (available only if the direction = _[input/output]_).
   - L4_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for
