Module "SM1"       (component SPIMaster_LDD)
   - SM1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - SM1_Deinit -This method deinitializes the device. It switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, 
                interrupts vectors, etc.
   - SM1_SendBlock -This method sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission 
                is not completed. The method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation.
   - SM1_ReceiveBlock -This method specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the specified 
                number of characters is received. The method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive 
                operation.
   - SM1_GetSentDataNum -Returns the number of sent characters. This method is available only if method SendBlock is enabled.
   - SM1_GetReceivedDataNum -Returns the number of received characters in the receive buffer. This method is available only if 
                the ReceiveBlock method is enabled.

Module "MCUC1"     (component McuLibConfig)
   - MCUC1_Init -Driver initialization method
   - MCUC1_Deinit -Driver deinitialization method

Module "WAIT1"     (component Wait)
   - WAIT1_Wait10Cycles -Wait for 10 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_Wait100Cycles -Wait for 100 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_WaitCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (16bit data type).
   - WAIT1_WaitLongCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (32bit data type).
   - WAIT1_Waitms -Wait for a specified time in milliseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitus -Wait for a specified time in microseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitns -Wait for a specified time in nano seconds.
   - WAIT1_WaitOSms -If an RTOS is enabled, this routine will use a non-blocking wait method. Otherwise it will do a 
                busy/blocking wait.
   - WAIT1_Init -Driver initialization routine.
   - WAIT1_DeInit -Driver de-initialization routine

Module "PDC1"      (component PDC8544)
   - PDC1_GetWidth -Returns the width of the display in pixels
   - PDC1_GetHeight -Returns the height of the display in pixels
   - PDC1_GetLongerSide -Returns the longer side of the display in pixels
   - PDC1_GetShorterSide -Returns the shorter side of the display in pixels
   - PDC1_SetDisplayOrientation -Sets current display orientation
   - PDC1_GetDisplayOrientation -Returns the current display orientation
   - PDC1_SetPos -Sets the cursor to the given position
   - PDC1_PutPixel -Writes a pixel to the display RAM buffer
   - PDC1_Clear -Clears the whole display memory.
   - PDC1_ClearLine -Clears a character line on the display
   - PDC1_WriteChar -Writes a single character to the display at the current position.
   - PDC1_WriteString -Writes a zero byte terminated string to the display at the current cursor position.
   - PDC1_WriteLineStr -Writes a string to the given line position.
   - PDC1_SetContrast -Sets the display contrast.
   - PDC1_SetMode -Sets the mode of the display (if inverted or not).
   - PDC1_UpdateFull -Updates the whole display
   - PDC1_UpdateRegion -Updates a region of the display
   - PDC1_GetLCD -Method to be called for mutual exclusive access to the LCD
   - PDC1_GiveLCD -Method to be called for mutual exclusive access to the LCD
   - PDC1_Init -Display driver initialization
   - PDC1_Deinit -Module Deinitialization

Module "LT"        (component BitIO)
   - LT_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - LT_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or a 
                register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - LT_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - LT_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "Cpu"       (component MKL25Z128LK4)
