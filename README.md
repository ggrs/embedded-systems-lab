# Embedded Systems Laboratory

This is the repository for the Embedded Systems Laboratory class.

The course consisted of building an IoT station based on the MQTT protocol using the FRDM-KL25z microcontroller.

The following peripherals were used:

* ESP-01 module (serial)
* ET-NOKIA LCD 5110 display (SPI)
* 5 V DC motor + L293D H-bridge module (timer + GPIOs)
* LM-61 temperature sensor (analog)
* 12-key keypad (4 GPIOs + 3 IRQ)
* Atmel 24C6 EEPROM (I2C)
* CodeWarrior IDE terminal plugin (UART)

For the final project the aforementioned components were used togheter with a PIR sensor in order to develop a remote secutiry system.
